Supporters of the coal industry have criticized President Barack Obama’s administration as it attempts to establish stricter environmental regulations on coal-fired plants in the U.S.
 
The Clean Power Plan is the administration’s latest initiative to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes restrictions on coal-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions.

On Feb. 9 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Clean Power Plan would not be allowed to go into effect until the court is able to hear arguments from those who support and oppose the plan.

Before that ruling, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt spoke out against the Clean Power Plan in a January press release.
 
Blunt said: “The administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work, and threatens to double utility costs for Missouri families by 2020.”

We decided to look into Blunt’s claim about jobs.

## Employment in the coal industry

Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that jobs in coal were declining well before Obama took office in 2009. Coal mining employment has been dropping since 1985.
